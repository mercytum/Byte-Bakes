# Project Overview

This project focuses on developing an online pastry store application that allows customers to customize their orders based on dietary needs and preferences. Many traditional pastry shops lack an effective online presence or functionality that enables users to easily customize orders while considering their caloric intake and dietary restrictions. Our solution aims to provide an intuitive platform that facilitates seamless order placement and customization, ensuring that customers can enjoy their favorite treats without compromising their health goals.

## Key Features
- **Customizable pastries**: Users can choose flavors, ingredients, toppings, and dietary options like vegan or low-calorie.
- **Calorie tracking**: Integration of FDA-compliant calorie labeling to help users make informed choices.
- **Streamlined user experience**: An intuitive interface built using ASP.NET Core MVC for frontend development, and C# and MySQL for backend and database management.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: ASP.NET Core MVC, HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: C#
- **Database**: MySQL
- **ORM**: Entity Framework
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **Project Management**: Jira

## Design Patterns
